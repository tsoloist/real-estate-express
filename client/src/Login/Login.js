			<p>Just let your mind wander and enjoy. This should make you happy. If what you're doing doesn't make you happy - you're doing the wrong thing. Just make little strokes like that. The least little bit can do so much. La- da- da- da- dah. Just be happy.</p>
			<p>That's a son of a gun of a cloud. I get carried away with this brush cleaning. Those great big fluffy clouds. Just think about these things in your mind and drop em' on canvas. Nice little clouds playing around in the sky.</p>
			<p>Look around, look at what we have. Beauty is everywhere, you only have to look to see it. Once you learn the technique, ohhh! Turn you loose on the world; you become a tiger. And that's when it becomes fun - you don't have to spend your time thinking about what's happening - you just let it happen.</p>
			<p>Isn't it great to do something you can't fail at? This is your creation - and it's just as unique and special as you are. I spend a lot of time walking around in the woods and talking to trees, and squirrels, and little rabbits and stuff. All you have to do is let your imagination go wild.</p>
			<p>You can do it. You have to make these big decisions. No worries. No cares. Just float and wait for the wind to blow you around. Anytime you learn something your time and energy are not wasted. It's cold, but it's beautiful. If I paint something, I don't want to have to explain what it is. Every time you practice, you learn more. Brown is such a nice color. Let your imagination be your guide. Just think about these things in your mind - then bring them into your world. We'll take a little bit of Van Dyke Brown. When you do it your way you can go anywhere you choose. If you hypnotize it, it will go away. You can create the world you want to see and be a part of. You have that power.</p>
			<p>Every single thing in the world has its own personality - and it is up to you to make friends with the little rascals. We're not trying to teach you a thing to copy. We're just here to teach you a technique, then let you loose into the world. God gave you this gift of imagination. Use it. Look around, look at what we have. Beauty is everywhere, you only have to look to see it. Everyone needs a friend. Friends are the most valuable things in the world.</p>
			<p>I really recommend you use odorless thinner or your spouse is gonna run you right out into the yard and you'll be working by yourself. Just beat the devil out of it. The shadows are just like the highlights, but we're going in the opposite direction.</p>
			<p>Let's have a little bit of fun today. If you don't like it - change it. It's your world. In this world, everything can be happy. Don't hurry. Take your time and enjoy. Nothing wrong with washing your brush. You can work and carry-on and put lots of little happy things in here.</p>
